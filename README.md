## Group 2: Eleanor Johnson, Emer McCourt, Georgia Sapsani, Kara Tsonos, Lauriane Suyin Chalmin-Pui, Rosie Barrie

The main **project report** can be found [here](Group2_ProjectReport.pdf). 

There are separate **Jupyter notebooks** for each section. Each notebook is annotated and has its standalone isntructions on how to run it, including libraries to be imported and any other required steps. 

1. Data merging: [A_Merging](/Group2_Files/Cleaning_and_Merging/A_Merging.ipynb)
2. Data cleaning: [B_Cleaning](/Group2_Files/Cleaning_and_Merging/B_Cleaning.ipynb)
3. Analysis Research Question 1: [1_Medal_Patterns](/Group2_Files/Key_Questions/1_Medal_Patterns.ipynb)
4. Analysis Research Question 2: [2_Athlete_Marketing](/Group2_Files/Key_Questions/2_Athlete_Marketing.ipynb)
5. Analysis Research Question 3: [3_NewSports](/Group2_Files/Key_Questions/3_NewSports.ipynb)
6. Analysis Research Question 4: [4a_Sports](/Group2_Files/Key_Questions/4a_Sports.ipynb) and [4b_ML](/Group2_Files/Key_Questions/4b_ML.ipynb)
7. Analysis Research Question 5: [5_2024results](/Group2_Files/Key_Questions/5_2024results.ipynb)


The **data files** used in the analysis, in the same directory, are the following:
- [clean_olympics_dataset.csv](/Group2_Files/Final_CSV_files/clean_olympics_dataset.csv)
- [medal_results_final.csv](/Group2_Files/Final_CSV_files/medal_results_final.csv)

The other remaining .csv data files were used in intermediary steps of data merging and are necessary to run the [data merging notebook](/Group2_Files/Cleaning_and_Merging/A_Merging.ipynb) so are also included.

 Lastly, there is also an [API folder](/Group2_Files/API/) containing the API used to collect data on the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The steps to access it are explained in the [API notebook](/Group2_Files/API/API.ipynb)
